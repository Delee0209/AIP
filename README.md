This is a repository for my "Advance Image Processing" homeworks

but mostly for me to play around different functionality of imGUI (like docking and different UI elements...)

containing functions like:
- image load/save
- resize
- gray scale
- add noise
- wavelet tranformation
- histogram equlization
- convolution / filter
- brightness analysis
